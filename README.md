# init-typescript
Command line utility to setup a new typescript project from a new node project

This is a not-very-polished setup script for making a virgin typescript project out of a virgin node project.

This currently is designed to work with yarn 2 and pnp.

For now it should be possible to `git clone` this and then `npm link` from inside it.  Then inside any new node project just run init-typescript for it to set everything up.
